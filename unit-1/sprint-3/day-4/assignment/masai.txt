My journey in Masai from begining not so good so got async in unit-1 and now I learn once again unit-1,

In masai many type of supports for students like as Ec, IA, and Instructor,etc,

And with the help of all mentors you doubt will be cleared easily,

Masai is on the basis of military coding School because it's timing is 11 am - 11 pm 6 days.
